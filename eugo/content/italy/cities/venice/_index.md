Winter has its perks too, like foggy mornings and fewer tourists, but be prepared for occasional high tides.

### Accessible Activities for All Ages

Venice has its challenges for those with mobility issues, but it’s far from impossible to enjoy. Look for accessible vaporettos and stick to areas like St. Mark’s Square, where ramps are more common. Many museums and attractions now offer wheelchair access. Planning ahead is key to ensuring a smooth experience.
