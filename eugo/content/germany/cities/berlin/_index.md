## Navigating Berlin’s Public Transport System

### Using the U-Bahn and S-Bahn Efficiently

*   **Safety**: Always lock your bike securely when parking.

For a leisurely ride, try quieter streets or parks like Tiergarten. Planning your route with a bike-friendly map can also help you avoid busy roads.
